- 👋 Hi, I’m Joan
- 👀 I’m interested in neuroscience. I am doing a PhD in NeuroImaging at Sano in Krakow. I am also collaborating in studying Reinforcement Learning models to explain dopamine properties. Machine Learning models of any kind, provided they are understandable.
- 🌱 Brain connectivity reconstruction techniques. Characterization of injured brain networks using funny mathematics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything you may find interesting!
